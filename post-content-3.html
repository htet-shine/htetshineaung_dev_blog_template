		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>
			Welcome to my website. <br />
			This is one of the first php projects I've created during my time studying web development. I wanted to create an online store with cash on delivery system. This project includes, browsing categories, products, shopping cart and checkout functionalities for the frontend and basic admin dashboard for the backend.
			<br /><br />
			I've spent hours upon hours searching for things that I wanted to do that I didn't learn in classes (not in great details anyway). Those includes ajax calls, responsive design, single file for php scripts, etc.
			<br /><br />
			I relied on jquery in this project for my ajax calls, some minor dom manipulations, datatables and popovers. Then I've learned that jquery is going out for better js frameworks.
			<br /><br />
			Anyway, it was a good learning experience. Lets see the scope in next section.

		<h2>Scope</h2>
		<ul class="bullet-list non-toc">
			<li><b>Users</b> will be able to
				<ul class="bullet-list non-toc">
					<li>browse products, categories</li>
					<li>use shopping cart</li>
					<li>order products with cash on delivery payment method</li>
				</ul>														
			</li>
			<br />
			<li><b>Admins</b> will be able to
				<ul class="bullet-list non-toc">
					<li>see overview of data</li>
					<li>add, edit, delete products</li>
					<li>add, edit, delete categories</li>
					<li>add, edit, delete sub-categories</li>

		<h2>Database Structure</h2>
		<div class="single-post-image-container">

			<!-- <img src="http://localhost/wordpress/htetshineaung_dev_blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/simple_laravel_blog2_db_1.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="auto" class="single-post-image alignnone size-full wp-image-228" /> -->

			<p>Image: Database</p>
		</div>
		<p>
			Database has seven tables. <br /> 
			As you can see in the image, a category, subcategory and brand can have many products but a product can have only one category. <br />
			A category can have many subcategories but a subcategory can have only one category. <br />
			An order can have many products, a product can have many orders. So, a join table "order_product" is created that store the IDs of orders and products. <br /> 	
			An order can only have one delivery location but a delivery location can have many orders. <br />
			Next, to the implementation.

		<h2>User Guide</h2>
		<p>
			In this section, I will walk you through how to use the application. First, lets start with installation. 
		</p> <br />
		<h3>Installation</h3>
		<p>
			If you already know how to set it up, download the project files and skip this part.<br />
			<ul class="bullet-list non-toc">
				<li>
					You need to download the project files <a class="link-custom-tld" href="#">here</a>.
				</li>
				<li>
					And xampp <a class="link-custom-tld" href="#">here</a>.
				</li>
				<br />
				<li>Install xampp and run Apache and MySQL.</li>
				<li>
					Go to "localhost/phpmyadmin" url in your browser and create a new database.
				</li>
				<li>
					Extract the download project zip file and indside "\SQL Setup\", you will find "DB_Backup.sql". Import that file into your newly created database.
				</li>
				<li>
					After that, open "\admin\config\config.php" with notepad or any text editor and change the following
<pre class="code-block">
$dbuser = "[your user name]";
$dbpass = "[your user password, default is blank]";
$dbname = "[your database name you created earlier]";
</pre>
				</li>
				<li>
					Copy the entire project folder to "xampp\htdocs" folder
				</li>
				<li>
					Open the browser and type in "localhost/[the project folder name]" and you will see the home page of the website.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<h3>Frontend user manual</h3>
		<p>
			 Frontend users should not require a manual to be able to use a website. The site UI should be intuitive enough for that. Especially for common sites like e-commerce, if you can use one, you can use others. <br />
			 But without assuming user expertise, I will show you how to use the website. 
		</p>
		<br />

		<h3>Home Page</h3>

			<p>Image 16: Managing Products</p>
		</div>
<br />
		<h3>Viewing, Adding, Editing and Deleting Brands</h3>
		<p>
			Pretty much the same principle as products.
		</p>
		<br />
		<div class="single-post-image-container">
			<img src="images/php_online_bag_store/php_online_bag_store_img18.jpg" alt="" class="single-post-image">
			<p>Image 17: Viewing Brands</p>
		</div>
		<div class="single-post-image-container">
			<img src="images/php_online_bag_store/php_online_bag_store_img19.jpg" alt="" class="single-post-image">
			<p>Image 18: Editing Brands</p>
		</div>
		<p>
			I will not show categories, sub categories and delivery as they are exactly the same as managing brands. One thing to note is A category must be present before you can add a sub category. Now onto the order page. 
		</p>
	<br />
		<h3>Managing Orders</h3>
		<p>
			This is where you can change status of orders and update stock.
		</p>
		<br />
		<div class="single-post-image-container">
			<img src="images/php_online_bag_store/php_online_bag_store_img23.jpg" alt="" class="single-post-image">
			<p>Image 19: Managing Orders</p>
		</div>
		<p>
			Each order is displayed with its id number and separated into 3 columns. Info of person who ordered, product(s) ordered, total cost and status of the order. Once order is delivered to the customer, you can update the stock and mark the order as delivered.
		</p>
		<br />
		<div class="single-post-image-container">
			<img src="images/php_online_bag_store/php_online_bag_store_img24.jpg" alt="" class="single-post-image">
			<p>Image 20: Order Delivered</p>
		</div>
		<p>
			Now the stock is updated and order is delivered.
		</p>
		<br />
	</div>

		<h2>Conclusion</h2>
		<p>
			First of all, is this project practical? No, its not. One of the biggest reason for that is security. I did not know how to use PHP PDO at the time of developing this project so SQL Injections attacks are welcome. And so many other security flaws. <br />
			Secondly, this kind of coding php is incredibly difficult and time consuming to read and debug for anyone. <br /><br />
			But what this project did give me is the learning experience and knowledge about 
			<ul class="bullet-list non-toc">
				<li>php</li>
				<li>sql queries</li>
				<li>jquery (dom manipulation, ajax calls, form validations, etc)</li>
				<li>responsive design</li>
				<li>many other ui/ux elements</li>
			</ul>
